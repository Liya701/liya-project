        <h1>Pablo Picasso</h1>
        <h2>Guernica is a large 1937 oil painting by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso.
             It is one of his best-known works, regarded by many art critics as the most moving and powerful anti-war painting in history.
             It is exhibited in the Museo Reina Sof√≠a in Madrid.
             The grey, black, and white painting, on a canvas 3.49 meters (11 ft 5 in) tall and 7.76 meters (25 ft 6 in) across,
              portrays the suffering wrought by violence and chaos.
              Prominently featured in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, 
              a dead baby, a dismembered soldier, and flames.
              Picasso painted Guernica at his home in Paris in response to the 26 April 1937 bombing of Guernica, a town in the Basque Country in northern Spain, by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.
               Upon completion, Guernica was exhibited at the Spanish pavilion at the 1937 Paris International Exposition and then at other venues around the world.
                The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief.
               The painting soon became widely acclaimed, helping to bring worldwide attention to the Spanish Civil War that took place from 1936 to 1939.
               Picasso worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April on the project's initial sketches, which depicted his perennial theme of an artist's studio.
                Then, immediately upon hearing reports of the 26 April bombing of Guernica, poet Juan Larrea visited Picasso's home to urge him to make the bombing his subject.
                 Days later, on 1 May, Picasso read George Steer's eyewitness account of the attack, which originally had been published in both The Times and The New York Times on 28 April, and abandoned his initial idea.
                Acting on Larrea's suggestion, Picasso began sketching a series of preliminary drawings for Guernica.
